> Investigative reporting on what matters

I worked w/ the founder to build this site and still maintain it today. The design side hasn't gotten all the love it deserves but as the old saying goes, "content is king". This is a passion project that aligns w/ my views on environmental policy change and transparent new reporting. <a href="https://environews.tv" target="_blank">environews.tv</a>

EnviroNews (the Company) is an independently owned and operated American news-reporting company powered by 100% original video and article content. From its inception until now, EnviroNews has published zero reprinted or syndicated content from other outlets. Sacrificing the common, quick and easy path to network growth and increased ad revenue, EnviroNews reporting is always built from scratch — even at the Headline News Desk. The Company does cover breaking news and beats, but specializes in the production of deep-dive, locally-based investigative reports and documentaries while upholding the strictest in journalistic ethics. EnviroNews has a codified policy barring the Editorial Board (a.k.a. The Editors) from endorsing political candidates — in contrast to many of the country’s leading news outlets.
