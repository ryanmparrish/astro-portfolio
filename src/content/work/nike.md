## Zero Nike 

I worked on the site zero, a subdomain of nike.com.<br>
(sorry this isn't a public domain) 🙁  

This is the internal website for Nike, a multinational corporation that designs, develops, manufactures, and markets footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services.

This site has a fully custom `Wordpress` backend and `angular.js` frontend. We served this fast ⚡ with a mid-tier mongo DB caching layer so we had fine grain control over the performance and stability.

I worked w/ the design team at Nike to constantly evolve this site over the years. There were numerous times where I was able to build out completely new user experiences to accommodate the happenings at the time. Do you remember the 2016 summer olympics in Rio? This was a fun feature to build out which kept up w/ the games awards and featured Nike athletes.

In addition to maintaining this sites speed, CMS configurations and operability. I worked closely w/ the design team to keep the site looking fresh and implement new features along the way.

#### Custom Wordpress admin layout settings

A few of the things I added were a dynamic masonry layout with filterable views, News and events that dynamically populated from multiple outside sources, Elastic search optimization to deliver the news in a multitude of ways and developed the evolving design integrations that were presented.
