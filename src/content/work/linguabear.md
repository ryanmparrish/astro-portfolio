## Language revitalization

> Inclusive Language Learning for Kids

I built this site along side w/ a friend who's uncompromising passion for language and learning bled into my own. This project is one-of-a-kind featuring an online version language teaching platform which mimics the plush toy that we also offer. Give it a try and learn some new languages today. <a href="linguabear.org" target="blank">LinguaBear.org</a>

At Lingua Bear, we are passionately committed to celebrating and revitalizing languages. We focus on helping individuals reestablish ties with their ancestral languages and assisting indigenous families in preserving their linguistic fluency, a key component of personal identity and community cohesion. Beyond this foundational goal, we recognize the significance of featuring languages from cultures and political backgrounds that have historically faced conflicts or injustices, such as Ukrainian and Russian, Hebrew and Palestinian Arabic, or Basque and Iberian Spanish. By highlighting these languages, we aim to foster unity and understanding, to bridge divides and bring people together.
