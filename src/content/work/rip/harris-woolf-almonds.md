I built this site for Harris Woolf Almonds in Python/Django with a custom CMS using wagtail. This was highly customizable and offered a quick author friendly way to promote their brand. Sadly like a lot of things the trees have all been shaken out and this site has been replaced. Peace be with you on your new digs and thanks for the great time while we had it. 
Have a look at the wayback machine <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230531160326/https://harriswoolfalmonds.com/about-us/" target="_blank">HWA old site</a>

Our roots run deep in the almond industry, serving businesses worldwide for over three decades, from entrepreneurs and chefs to global CPG brands.

As an independent, grower-owned, and vertically integrated almond processor, we can guarantee the safety and quality of our products, the sustainability of our methods, and the durability of our supply chains. We ensure all this while meeting our customersâ€™ unique needs and delivering a hands-on, personalized business experience.
