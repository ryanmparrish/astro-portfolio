## Adobe AEM
I worked on the Adobe team for the past 3+ years helping them develop a new Adobe Experience Manger. [aem.live](https://www.aem.live/) is the official website for Adobe Experience Manager (AEM), a content management system (CMS) used by businesses to create and manage digital experiences. 

This systems focus is...
 - speed and ease of development
 - scalability and reliability
 - integrations w/ existing systems
 - tools for developers and quality engineers. 

> This is build on the principle to use the technology you already have

Keeping our authors in mind we don't expect them to have a doctorate in a complex CMS and instead have an agnostic text authoring environment in tools you already are familiar with like Microsoft Word or Google Docs. A CMS that gets out of the way gets your content on the way.

I helped build this from day one and have my hand in most the blocks that are created to compose all of [adobe.com](https://www.adobe.com/) and subsidiary sites like [business.adobe.com](https://business.adobe.com/), [Document Cloud](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/business.html), [Experience Cloud](https://business.adobe.com/products/adobe-experience-cloud-products.html),  This tool is referred to for clients as [AEM.live](https://www.aem.live/) (Adobe experience manager) and internally as project [Milo](https://milo.adobe.com/) where all the sites under adobe.com are authored.

You may have heard of AEM as it's been around for a long time. The initial implementation of this system, built in JAVA has a robust CMS backend and complicated implementation. I am a contributor to this project as well but my primary focus at Adobe was helping build the next version of this offering [aem.live](https://www.aem.live/)

### MILO and AEM.live

> Chances are if it's on adobe.com, I've worked on it!

The milo team has been working on a series of cross-cloud design elements to support the migration of [adobe.com](https://www.adobe.com/) and related domains (AEM -> MILO). The first column shows some of these entities that consume milo core for their component library. The second column showcases the easy authoring from a familiar cloud based document to an instant live url. The third column has a few images from these design elements on live adobe urls.

### Adobe blog
The adobe blog has had a long windy road and fortunately is on stable ground now. I helped the migration from the original site to the newly platformed <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/" target="_blank">blog.adobe.com</a> to operate under the document cloud based authoring aem.live. This required many migration scrips and careful localization efforts to fine tune the delivery. Once the initial work was done, we successfully migrated all of the blog entries and taxonomy relations to be adapted into this new system. Good bye to the old and in w/ the new. As with life it's always about reinventing yourself and this is no exception.

### Adobe Consonant
Consonant is Adobes design system. Built for unity across all the adobe.com subsidiary sites. The aim is to have consistency and control over their style guide and designs so all the pages under this umbrella have a unified look and feel. I worked on the liaison between design, project owners, stake holders and developers to maintain sanity between this dynamic solar system.
