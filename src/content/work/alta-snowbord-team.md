I built and maintain the site <a href="https://altasnowboardteam.com" target="_blank">altasnowboardteam.com</a>

This is build on `wordpress` and features an e-commerce service. I've worked w/ the founder in developing this site so there is a place to buy swag, post recent updates and have a place for the chaos that is brewing up Utah's coveted little cottonwood canyon. Shred the gnar and get some swag today.

## Alta Snowboard Team

Many Utah snowboarders as well as avid traveling riders have been frustrated by the policy of not allowing riders to load the lifts.  The Alta Snowboard Team has not and will not be discouraged by a mere lift restriction.  AST shall not be kept from shredding the amazing snow that falls on the magical slopes of Alta.

> “Alta is a Skiers’ Mountain. <br> No Snowboarding Allowed.”

The “forbidden fruit” nature of a ski-only resort has snowboarders anxiously awaiting the day Alta opens its doors to sideways-sliders.  After all, it was said, “Hell would freeze over before snowboarders were allowed at Taos.”  As of March 19th, 2008 the ban against snowboarders at Taos, NM was lifted and riders were allowed equal access.  The skier/snowboarder division has been a long-time debate and will continue to be an issue (mostly to the un-informed and largely un-jazzed).  For now, the policy is clear and Alta doesn’t want snowboarders on their mountain (even though it is Forest Service land paid for equally by tax payers).  Furthermore, Alta and Snowbird resorts operate interdependently almost as two divisions of one large ski area giving snowboarders access to Alta via a 5-minute hike (hippies use the back door).  Will the AST let a ridge, short hike, or the disapproval of skiing’s older, crankier and close-minded population keep them separated?  Nope.
